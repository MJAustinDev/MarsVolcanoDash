The following license applies to my work and my work alone.
The license can also be found in comment form at the top of my files.

This license applies to all .cpp and .h files within these directories and their sub-directories:
- GameControl/
- GameEntities/
- GameEntities/Enemy/
- Utility/
- Visuals/

The only exceptions are the file GameControl/entry.cpp, Visuals/Icons/gameIcon.h and Visuals/Icons/gameIcon.rc.
This is because I don't see any point attempting to copyright the entry point file as it's a basic gameloop similar to any other GLFW application.
And I don't see any point attempting to copyright two very small single files which only set the applications icon,
hence only the capitalised section of the license applies all 3 of these files.
